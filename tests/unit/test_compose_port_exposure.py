"""Zero services are reachable from outside the host.

BACKEND_GAP_ANALYSIS.md P0: "เปิด public port เฉพาะ reverse proxy/API ที่จำเป็น
และให้ PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, MLflow และ Ollama อยู่ใน network ภายใน", with
the acceptance criterion "การสแกน port จากภายนอกเข้าถึงได้เฉพาะบริการที่ตั้งใจเปิด".

Round 3 tightened this from "only `api` is public" to "nothing is public at
all". `cloudflared` (a Cloudflare Tunnel client) is now the sole ingress: it
makes outbound-only connections to Cloudflare's edge and needs no inbound
port on this host, and it forwards everything to `edge` (nginx) over the
compose network. `edge` is the only thing that talks to `api`, and `api`
itself now binds loopback like every other internal service.

A published Docker port defaults to `0.0.0.0`, so `"5432:5432"` puts Postgres
on every interface the host has. Prefixing `127.0.0.1:` keeps it reachable
locally — `docker compose exec`, and an SSH tunnel, which is what
`scripts/deploy_pasaflow_vm.sh` hands the operator for the MinIO console,
MLflow, Ollama, and now the `api`/`edge` loopback ports too — while an
external scan sees nothing.

This is a text/structure guard on `docker-compose.yml` (and, for the
ingress-bypass check below, `docker/cloudflared/config.yml`) rather than an
integration test: these files ARE the security boundary, there is little
runtime behaviour to observe short of standing up the whole stack, and a
regression here can be a one-character deletion (dropping `127.0.0.1:`) that
nothing else would catch. It is deliberately strict — a new service that
publishes a port has to come here and declare itself.
